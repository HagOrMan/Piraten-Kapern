# A1 - Piraten Karpen

  * Author: Kyle Hagerman
  * Email: hagermak@mcmaster.ca
  
 Piraten Karpen simulates the board game of the same name with two players. The user can specify whether they want each player to play randomly or maximize combos. It runs 42 games and prints win percentages after they are done, as well as logs important information in PiratenKarpen.log.

## Build and Execution

  * To clean your working directory:
    * `mvn clean`
  * To compile the project:
    * `mvn compile`
  * To run the project in development mode, use a trace value of 0 if you want trace disabled, 1 if enabled.
  * Choose 'combo' or 'random' for the player arguments:
    * `mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.args="trace player1 player2"` (here, `-q` tells maven to be _quiet_)
  * To package the project as a turn-key artefact:
    * `mvn package`
  * To run the packaged delivery, use a trace value of 0 if you want trace disabled, 1 if enabled.
  * Choose 'combo' or 'random' for the player arguments:
    * `java -jar target/piraten-karpen-jar-with-dependencies.jar trace player1 player2`

## Feature Backlog

 * Status: 
   * Pending (P), Started (S), Blocked (B), Done (D)
 * Definition of Done (DoD):
